# Husman Moderna

[The actual website](https://husman-moderna-b3b264b75487.herokuapp.com/home/)

Husman Moderna is a full-stack website created for a fictitious restaurant where the user can read the menu, book a table, leave reviews, etc. As a user, you first create an account to gain access to all functions on the website, but even non-registered visitors have access to the menu, can learn about the restaurant and read reviews from the community.

This website not only aims to simplify the reservation process but also fosters a vibrant community of food enthusiasts eager to explore and discuss the culinary delights Husman Moderna has to offer.

## Testing

### Automated Testing

Automated testing has been implemented in the projects workspace. Views and Models have been tested within all affected apps. The auto-generated "tests.py" files have been deleted and instead "tests" folders have been added to affected apps. Within the tests folders, the test files have been added with clear names that describe what is being tested. This is to create clarity around the structure of the project. The Home app has no tests, as it was not relevant. Also, within each "tests" folder, an empty file called init.py has been created. This makes it possible for Django's test runner to discover and run tests contained within that directory or its subdirectories.

The automated testing is not comprehensive, but it gives an indication of the developer's ability to create automated tests.

## Credits

### Content

- The text content on the web page has been partly modified by Bengt Liljenroth in order to achieve a neater language.

### Code

#### Tutorials

- The walkthrough "I Think Therefore I Blog" from [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) has been used as a pillar to create the structure.

- [Django Recipe Sharing Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBjbty691eI&list=PLXuTq6OsqZjbCSfiLNb2f1FOs8viArjWy) has also been used as a support to create structure for various functions. 

#### Websites

- [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/) has been used frequently to create the web page.

- This previous PP4 project has been used as a source of inspiration and also as a tool, using DevTools, for various codes (especially in the creation of the menu and footer): [Tasty Bites](https://tasty-bites-rb-427304cf20b7.herokuapp.com/)

- [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) have been used to get the right classes.

- [EmailJS docs](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/) were used to implement their functionality correctly in the project.
